#TODO Flow

- Angular route guards  
  - See what options are there
  - Select option
  - Apply route guards to all pages according to the rules
    - If user and admin show stuff differently
    - show different components, or same components but different visibility?
      - different visibility is too much stuff on the view
      - different components based on role is too much components
    - on the other hand different components by role is easier to make fast.
    
So Route Guards are generally working now...
